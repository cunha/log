/* This module creates rotating filenames based on creating time
 * (cyc_init_periodic) or file size (cyc_init_filesize).  The interface is
 * simple: (1) initialize the cyclic file handle, (2) print stuff to it, and
 * (3) destroy the handle when you are done.
 *
 * These functions use pthread_setcancelstate to prevent file-handling
 * functions to work as cancellation points.  This way the calling thread can
 * be sure that all functions will return.
